 * @title BaseImmutableAdminUpgradeabilityProxy

 * mechanism for administrative tasks. The admin role is stored in an immutable, which
 * helps saving transactions costs
 * All external functions in this contract must be guarded by the
 * `ifAdmin` modifier. See ethereum/solidity#3864 for a Solidity
 * feature proposal that would enable this to be done automatically.
